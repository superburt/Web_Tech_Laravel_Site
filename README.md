# Web_Tech_Laravel_Site
This is a website made using Laravel, for an assignment. 95% working, a small validation error I've yet to fix, as well as some sql naming mess. 

The interesting content (html, css, php) is located under resources/views , routes/web.php, database/create_post_table.sql, for those unfamiliar with laravel layouts.
